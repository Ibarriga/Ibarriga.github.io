### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

   Lab 12, part 1, was a favorite because I always wanted to know how to code animations. Although the animation was just colors, it was a great learning experience trying new things. With this lab, I could use the knowledge I gained to create my first animation from scratch.
 
* Lab 9

   Lab 9, part 2, was one of my favorites because it was the first time we used outside code to access outside files. The game consisted of trying to guess the number the other person set. Overall, the game was enjoyable to code and play with friends. 

* Lab 7

   Lab 7, part 2, was one of my favorite labs as I never understood how to play Blackjack, let alone code it. Reading the rules and making the game was exciting as I learned two things simultaneously. In the end, I still use the same coded game to play with my family and friends.
